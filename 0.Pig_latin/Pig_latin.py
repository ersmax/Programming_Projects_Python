# Pig latin is a silly made-up language that alters English words. 
# If a word begins with a vowel, the word yay is added to the end of it. 
# If a word begins with a consonant or consonant cluster (like ch or gr), 
# that consonant or consonant cluster is moved to the end of the word and followed by ay.

# Letâ€™s write a pig latin program that will output something like this:

# Enter the English message to translate into pig latin:
# My name is AL SWEIGART and I am 4,000 years old.
# Ymay amenay isyay ALYAY EIGARTSWAY andyay Iyay amyay 4,000 yearsyay oldyay.

print('Enter the English message to translate into pig latin:')
message = input()
VOWELS = ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u')

def pig_latin(message):
    pig_latin = []
    
    for word in message.split():
        prefix_non_letters = ''
        # check first letter not a number
        while len(word) > 0 and not word[0].isalpha():  
            prefix_non_letters += word[0]
            word = word[1:]
        if len(word) == 0:
            pig_latin.append(prefix_non_letters)
            continue
    
    # remove non letters at the end
    suffix_non_letters = ''
    while not word[-1].isalpha():
        suffix_non_letters += word[-1]
        word = word[:-1]
    
    was_upper = word.isupper()
    was_title = word.istitle()

    word = word.isttitle()
